# :pushpin: About the Project

Luxembourg Map is an interactive application that visualizes the map of Luxembourg city using a graph of nodes and arcs. 
The application allows users to select a start node and a destination node, and the path between them is computed using graph algorithms (in this case, Dijkstra's algorithm).
The vehicle's animation along the path is displayed in an interactive window, allowing zoom and drag features for map navigation.
This was a part of a homework of the Graphs Algorithms lab.


# :rocket: Installation and run the project
  1. Clone or download the repository.
  2. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later installed.
  3. The application will launch a GUI displaying the map of Luxembourg. Interact with the map by selecting a start and destination node, and watch the vehicle animate along the path.

# :desktop_computer: Technologies and Libraries used:
1. [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) for the implementation of the application.
2. Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI) and rendering.
3. [Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) for calculating the shortest path between two nodes.
4. [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/) (for Pair): Used to hold pairs of integers (such as node connections and their distances).

 This project is developed by `Negoita Andrei` and it was a homework for the Graphs Algorithms lab,in the second year of the Computer Science faculty
